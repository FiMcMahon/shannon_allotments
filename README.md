## Key Project Goals
This project has 2 main objectives:
* As an informative website about a community based garden 
* This Website was created for the purpose of completing the portfolio 1 Project for Diploma in Software Development. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document.


## Brief
The website should inform on and promote Shannon Allotments ethos and commitment to improving the local natural environment. It should allow members of the public an easy access route for contacting the allotment group.
It should include:

* A brief explanation of the Allotments location and organising body.
* A gallery showcasing the work on the allotments.
* A contact form for enquiries.
* Links to social media

## Target Audience
Gardeners, Public in the local area, people interested in nature and the environment

## UX: User Experience
### User Stories  

As a user I want to be able to:

* Understand the purpose of the site on loading
* Navigate through the site smoothly
* See examples of ongoing work on the allotment plots
* Be able to contact the allotment group easily
* Be able to join a newsletter
* Learn more about gardening
* Grow my own vegetables
* Learn more about community groups in my area
* Volunteer with community groups
* Understand more about biodiversity
* Connect with the Allotment group on social media


## Wireframes
The Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq. The final site varies from the wireframes due to developments that occurred during the building process.

### Contact Page:

## Site Structure
Shannon Allotments is a 4 page website. The home page is the default loading page.The other pages are accessible from the navigation menu at all times.

## Colour Scheme
My colour scheme will take inspiration from the logo image including antiquewhite,greens and black. After some experimentation I settled on some different shades of the original selection to ensure contrast was optimised for a good UX.

## Typography
The font used were imported into the css from google fonts. Courier Prime was selected to give positive, informal and welcoming theme into the text elements of the site. Courier New  is the nominated fallback font, due to it’s simplicity, therefore allowing it to integrate well into the site should the other fonts not load.

## Imagery
Imagery is important on this site to convey the type of environment and people involved in Shannon Allotments. The images serve to inspire or entice a beginner gardener. The gallery images are aligned for optimal viewing and user experience.

## Features
The site contains common features such as a navigational bar and footer, familiar to all internet users. This creates a friendly and non intimidating environment in which the user can feel comfortable to explore the pages, make return visits, and enjoy a positive user experience.

## Existing Features
### Home
The bottom of the page contains a location map the user wants to visit the site.
![Home Page Full Screen Image](/assets/images/readme_images/homepage.PNG)
#### Navigational Bar
Heading each page top, it’s responsive and links to all pages, reachable at any time within the user's journey through the site. 
![Nav Bar Image](/assets/images/readme_images/navbar.PNG)
#### Footer
At the bottom of all pages, is the footer. It’s minimal in style and contains the centralised social media links, opening in separate tabs for a great UX. 
![Footer Image](/assets/images/readme_images/footer.PNG)
### Gallery
Representative images are displayed in one simple and symmetrical gallery, with an off white  backdrop for visual impact.
![Gallery Page Image](/assets/images/readme_images/gallerypage.PNG)
### News
Via pictures and text placed on a responsive grid, users can find out more about the ethos at the allotment and the importance of biodiversity. It contains a short paragraph describing current biodiversity projects running at the Allotments. The image also shows the work in progress in the biodiversity garden.

![News Page Image](/assets/images/readme_images/newspage.PNG)
### Contact
The contact page contains a simple and fully responsive form, via which users can contact the Allotment group without having to leave the site. This page completes the user’s journey through the site and is designed to be calm, simple and reassuring, with 4 labelled inputs and a submit button styled in keeping with the rest of the site. The form is set against a visually appealling garden scene in keeping with the style of the site for great UX.

## Future Features
I have noticed just prior to submission, potential issues wih the contact page responsivity. With more time, I would investigate further, re-testing over smaller screen sizes. 
I had hoped to utilise the hamburger navbar for smaller screens, to improve UX on mobile devices  this would be a future feature I would like to employ.

## Credits
### Content
Many issues were at least partly resolved by searching Stack Overflow, w3schools and MDN Docs.
Harry, a Code Institue mentor helped with my understanding of a responsive css nav bar.
Inspiration for the README.md came from Tasha Taylor Johnson's repository.
Content from the Gardening for Biodiversity booklet by Juanita Browne was included on the News Page.

### Code
Throughout the building process I found many helpful tutorials online. I sometimes applied principles within them to the site, after fully understanding their code and modifying to fit the site's needs.
For example for a responsive Youtube video I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YffrCViTVk).

The image gallery, navbar and contact form were inspired by Code Institutes Love Running project

## Acknowledgements
This website was executed and completed as a portfolio 1 Project for Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications) at Code Institute. I would like to firstly thank my mentor,  Harry Dhillon for his patience and guidance. Shannon Allotments is a real concept, but the website is purely for the sake of the developer's portfolio and not for public consumption.
