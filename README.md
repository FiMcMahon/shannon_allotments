## Site Structure
Shannon Allotments is a 4 page website. The home page is the default loading page.The other pages are accessible from the navigation menu at all times.

## Colour Scheme
My colour scheme will take inspiration from the logo image including antiquewhite,greens and black. After some experimentation I settled on some different shades of the original selection to ensure contrast was optimised for a good UX.

## Typography
The font used were imported into the css from google fonts. Courier Prime was selected to give positive, informal and welcoming theme into the text elements of the site. Courier New  is the nominated fallback font, due to it’s simplicity, therefore allowing it to integrate well into the site should the other fonts not load.

## Imagery
Imagery is important on this site to convey the type of environment and people involved in Shannon Allotments. The images serve to inspire or entice a beginner gardener. The gallery images are aligned for optimal viewing and user experience.

## Features
The site contains common features such as a navigational bar and footer, familiar to all internet users. This creates a friendly and non intimidating environment in which the user can feel comfortable to explore the pages, make return visits, and enjoy a positive user experience.

## Existing Features
### Home
The bottom of the page contains an address and map to Craig's studio should the user want to visit.
### Navigational Bar
Heading each page top, it’s fully responsive and toggles to a neat hamburger menu. It contains links to all pages, reachable at any time within the user's journey through the site. 

## Footer
At #the bottom of all pages, is the footer. It’s minimal in style and contains the centralised social media links, opening in separate tabs for a great UX. 

### Gallery
Representative images are displayed in one simple and symmetrical gallery, with an off white  backdrop for visual impact.
### News
Via pictures and text placed on a fully responsive grid, users can find out more about the ethos at the allotment and the importance of biodiversity. It contains a short paragraph describing current biodiversity projects running at the Allotments. It also the work in progress biodiversity garden.

## Contact
The contact page contains a simple and fully responsive form, via which users can contact the Allotment group without having to leave the site. This page completes the user’s journey through the site and is designed to be calm, simple and reassuring, with 4 labelled inputs and a submit button styled in keeping with the rest of the site. The form is set against a visually appealling garden scene in keeping with the style of the site for great UX.

## Content
Many issues were at least partly resolved by searching Stack Overflow and w3schools
Harry, a Code Institue mentor helped with my understanding of a responsive css nav bar.
Inspiration for the README.md came from Tasha Taylor Johnson's repository

## Media
All photos are either my own or exists in the public domain already.

## Code
Throughout the building process I found many helpful tutorials online. I sometimes applied principles within them to the site, after fully understanding their code and modifying to fit the site's needs.

The hamburger menu was inspired by this youtube tutorial
The image gallery was inspired by Code Institutes Love Running project
The sticky footer was inspired by this tutorial

## Acknowledgements
This website was executed and completed as a portfolio 1 Project for Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications) at Code Institute. I would like to firstly thank my mentor,  Harry Dhillon for his patience and guidance. Shannon Allotments is a real concept, but the website is purely for the sake of the developer's portfolio and not for public consumption.
