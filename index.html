            <div>
            <p>
               Shannon Allotments is a small public group of allotments located in Shannon, Co.Clare, Ireland.
               Located near to the banks of the Shannon Estuary, we are a group of about 40 allotment holders growing our own vegetables, fruit and herbs.
               Allotment sites vary in size from small to large; all are currently occupied but to add your name to the waiting list to rent an allotment, an application form can be found on Clare County Council website.
            </p>
            <p>
               At the Shannon allotments we take a holistic approach to gardening.
               Organic methods, reducing the use of pesticides or using more natural methods to manage pests is important to both us and the natural environment around the allotments.
            </p>
            <p>
               We have a large communal composting bay that is used to compost both organic waste from the allotment gardens, grass cuttings and leaves. 
               Each individual garden also has their own compost bin, combining organic matter from the garden, kitchen and incorporating cardboard or mulch to produce their own compost to be returned to the garden, enriching the soil once the compost has broken down.
            </p>
            <p>
               Conservation of water is important and necessary especially in summer months when local reserves can run low. 
               For this reason a water harvesting system was built using recycled guttering, a large collection tank and a frame built from reclaimed or recycled timber. 
               This allows for water to be collected from the roof of a large storage container situated in the centre of the site. 
               The water is collected into a large container and several smaller water butts for use throughout the drier days and months of the year. 
            </p>
