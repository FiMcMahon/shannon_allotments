    <h2>Gardening for Biodiversity</h2>
    <p> Irelandâ€™s countryside is becoming more and more managed,more uniform.
        In Ireland, we are seeing declines in our insect, bird, fish, mammal and amphibian populations. 
        This is due to a variety of factors,including habitat loss,habitat fragmentation,pesticide use and climate change.

        <p>
        We understand that every garden counts and in addition to providing support for the wildlife eco system, gardening for biodiversity also has advantages for human health and wellbeing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Individually we grow combinations of fruit,vegetables,herbs and flowers in our allotment plots that can be beneficial to the wildlife ecosystem around us. 
        In addition to this we are developing an area outside the front of the site that has been wildly overgrown with grass and weeds. 
        This area is a communal spot, a place where the general public can come to volunteer or enjoy.  
        <br>
        <br>
        The Biodiversity Garden is specially reserved to plant a rich array of different plants to attract pollinators such as bees, butterflies and birds. 
        It should also provide food and shelter for wildlife. There is still much work to be done to develop this area, please go to the contact page and send a message if you are interested in volunteering some time to dig, plant and maintain this area.
